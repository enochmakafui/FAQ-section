# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion

![Design preview for the FAQ accordion coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)



## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

 Users should be able to: 

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
